Sage BOM Automation
Automate the updating process of Bills of Materials (BOM) in Sage with this Python script.

Overview
Managing Bills of Materials (BOM) in Sage can be a cumbersome task, often involving manual data entry and navigation through the Sage interface. This Python script aims to simplify this process by automating the repetitive tasks involved in updating BOMs.

Features
Excel Integration: Read BOM data from an Excel file, allowing for easy manipulation and updating of BOMs outside of Sage.
User Interaction: Interact with the Sage interface using simulated mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to update BOMs.
Customization: Easily adjust cursor positions and script behavior to accommodate different Sage setups and workflows.
Efficiency: Save time and reduce errors by automating the repetitive tasks associated with managing BOMs in Sage.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
pyautogui
pynput
Usage
Prepare your BOM data in an Excel file with the required columns: Bill Number, Component Item Code, NumOfTab, Quantity/Bill.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions to set cursor positions and initiate the automation process.
Sit back and let the script handle the tedious task of updating BOMs in Sage.
Note: It's essential to backup your data before running the script, as it performs automated actions that could affect your Sage data.
